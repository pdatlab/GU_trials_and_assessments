Patient Global Impression of Improvement

Single question with the following possible responses:

1. Very much better
2. Much better
3. A little better
4. No change
5. A little worse
6. Much worse
7. Very much worse

Co-developed with the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) scale asking about current LUTS (normal, mild, moderate, severe).

Note, PGII can be applied to multiple categories. In ROSETTA there are two PGI-I, one for "urinary leakage" and another for "bladder function"
