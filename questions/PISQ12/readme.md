#Scoring

"Scores are calculated by totaling the scores for each question with O=never, 4=always. Reverse scoring is used for items 1,2,3 and 4. The short form questionnaire can be used with up to two missing responses. To handle missing values the sum is calculated by multiplying the number of items by the mean of the answered items. If there are more than two missing responses, the short fonn no longer accurately predicts long form scores. Short fonn scores can only be reported as total or on an item basis. Although the short form reflects the content of the three factors in the long form, it is not possible to analyze data at the factor level. To compare long and short fom1 scores multiply the short form score by 2.58 (12/31)" (Rogers et al. 2003)
