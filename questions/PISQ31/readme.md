# Scoring #

"Scores were calculated by totaling the scores for each question, from 0 (always) to 4 (never), with the exception of question 5, which was scaled from 0 (always) to 5 (do not masturbate). Individual factor scores were calculated by adding the scores for the individual items in each factor. Reverse scoring was used for items 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, and 29. Factor 1 contained questions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, and 29; factor 2 contained questions 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, and 30; factor 3 contained questions 3, 4, 14, 15, 28, and 31. To handle missing values, the researcher calculated the sum by multiplying the number of items by the mean of the answered items." (Rogers et al. 2001)
