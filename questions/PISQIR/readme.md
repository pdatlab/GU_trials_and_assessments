Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire, IUGA Revised (**IR**)

# Motivation #

**From Rogers et al. 2013**
"Questionnaires utilized to assess sexual health among women with PFDs share common limitations (10). None of the questionnaires have been validated in a population of women with AI, nor have they been developed within a framework that intentionally included women without a partner or those who did not consider themselves to be sexually active. This may underestimate PFD impact on sexual function since women with severe PFD may elect to become sexually inactive. A validated sexual measure that evaluates not only the impact of PFDs on sexual function but also PFD impact on sexual activity is needed. The questionnaire should have proven responsiveness in evaluating treatment outcomes as well as validity and reliability. This multicenter international study, sponsored by the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA), was designed to address the above limitations in current sexual function measures. We aimed to build upon prior work and establish the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of a revised PISQ, the PISQ-IUGA-revised or PISQ-IR."
